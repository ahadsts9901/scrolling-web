        <h2 id="Elephant">Elephant</h2>
        <p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on earth and have distinctly massive bodies, large ears, and long trunks. They use their trunks to pick up objects, trumpet warnings, greet other elephants, or suck up water for drinking or bathing, among other uses.</p>
        <h2 id="Lion">Lion</h2>
        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.</p>
        <h2 id="Monkey">Monkey</h2>
        <p>Monkeys are intelligent animals that are good at solving problems. Almost all types live together in groups. A monkey group commonly includes several related females, their young, and one or more males. Monkeys use facial expressions, body movements, and various noises to communicate with each other.</p>
        <h2 id="Snake">Snake</h2>
        <p>A snake is a reptile with a long, thin body but no legs. Some lizards are legless and look like snakes, however, most lizards have eyelids, and snakes do not. All snakes eat live prey, which is grabbed and swallowed whole without chewing it into pieces.</p>
        <h2 id="Crocodile">Crocodile</h2>
        <p>Crocodiles have powerful jaws with many conical teeth and short legs with clawed webbed toes. They share a unique body form that allows the eyes, ears, and nostrils to be above the water surface while most of the animal is hidden below. The tail is long and massive, and the skin is thick and plated</p>
        <h2 id="Bear">Bear</h2>
        <p>Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as small as four feet long and about 60 pounds (the sun bear) to as big as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds (the polar bear). They're found throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.</p>
        <h2 id="Horse">Horse</h2>
        <p>The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today.</p>
